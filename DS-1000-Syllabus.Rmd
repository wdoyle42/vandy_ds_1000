We have entered a time in which vast amounts of data are more widely available than ever before. At the same time, a new set of tools has been developed to analyze this data and provide decision makers with information to help them accomplish their goals. Those who engage with data and interpret it for organizational leaders have taken to calling themselves data scientists, and their craft data science. Other terms that have come into vogue are big data, predictive analytics, and data mining. 

This course will teach students how data science is used to make key decisions across multiple domains. Data science involves bringing together programming and high powered computing to analyze data using statistics. Data scientists provide insights that allow leaders in business, government and other institutions to make decisions. Students will engage directly with problems in data science, with hands-on work with real world data. Each topic area will also engage with leading intellectuals who are working in a given area. 

This class will focus on using various real-world examples to teach important topics in data science. Students will learn about the following key concepts in data science:

- Structuring and Manipulating Data
- Data Visualization
- Making Predictions from Data
- Understanding Error in Predictions
- Training and Testing Models


## Evaluation

Students will work in groups on five guided exercises. These exercise will challenge you to implement the skills we discuss in class. 

For each module, small teams of students will complete a narrative report on the implementation of a given tool regarding a given concept. The focus of these reports will be explaining an applied data analysis to an external audience, and will include both text and data visualizations. A randomly selected team of students will present these results to the group at the end of each module.  

Evaluation for the course will be based on student completion of assignments and student participation. Assignments will be graded on a 100 percent scale, with each assignment worth 15% of the final grade. The final 10% of the final grade will be based on student participation, which includes attending course meetings and completing in-class prompts. 

## Required Texts

We will have two texts for the course. The first is Hadley Wickham's book, R for Data Science:

Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for data science: Import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. San Francisco, CA: O'Reilly Media, Inc.

The other text is Nate Silver's Signal and the Noise:

Silver, N. (2012). The signal and the noise: Why so many predictions fail—but some don’t. New York, NY: Penguin.

## Software
 
We will use only free, open-source software in this course.

We will use R, an open-source data analytic platform for all analysis. R appears to be the most widely used data analysis software in data science. We will utilize RStudio as our integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

## Honor Code Statement

All assignments for this class, including weekly problem sets and the final project, are to be conducted under the obligations set out in Vanderbilt's Honor Code. [Please click here to review the Honor Code](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/).
