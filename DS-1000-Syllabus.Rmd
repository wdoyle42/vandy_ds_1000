## Introduction to Data Science

We have entered a time in which vast amounts of data are more widely available than ever before. At the same time, a new set of tools has been developed to analyze this data and provide decision makers with information to help them accomplish their goals. Those who engage with data and interpret it for organizational leaders have taken to calling themselves data scientists, and their craft data science. Other terms that have come into vogue are big data, predictive analytics, and data mining. These can seem to be mysterious domains. The point of this class is to demystify much of this endeavor for individuals who will be organizational leaders.
The class is structured around developing students' skills in three areas: getting data, analyzing data to make predictions, and presenting the results of analysis. For each area, the subtopics are as follows:

## Evaluation

Students will work in groups on five guided exercises. These exercise will challenge you to implement the skills we discuss in class. Each assignment will be worth 20% of your overall grade. 

## Required Texts

We will have two texts for the course. The first is Hadley Wickham's book, R for Data Science:

Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for data science: Import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. San Francisco, CA: O'Reilly Media, Inc.

The other text is Nate Silver's Signal and the Noise:

Silver, N. (2012). The signal and the noise: Why so many predictions fail—but some don’t. New York, NY: Penguin.

## Software
 
We will use only free, open-source software in this course.

We will use R, an open-source data analytic platform for all analysis. R appears to be the most widely used data analysis software in data science. We will utilize RStudio as our integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
