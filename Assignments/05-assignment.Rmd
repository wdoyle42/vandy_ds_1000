1. Calculate the proportion who yielded as a function of income decile and comment briefly on the results. 
2. Run a regression with yield as a function of income and sent scores. Comment on the coefficients. 3. Run a logistic regression with yield as a function of income and sent scores. Again comment on the coefficients. 
4. Calculate the acccuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the predictions from your logistic regression above. Comment briefly on each. 
5. Calculate the AUC from the logistic regression and state whether you have achieved good model fit.
