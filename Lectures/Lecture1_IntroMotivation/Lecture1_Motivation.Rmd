# Course Motivation via ``Tweets"
-  "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data." Sherlock Holmes

- "Data is the sword of the 21st century, those who wield it the samurai." Jonathan Rosenberg, former Senior Vice President of Products at Google and current advisor to Alphabet Inc. CEO Larry Page

-  "Torture the data, and it will confess to anything." Ronald Coase, Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics 
- “Here’s an open secret of the big data world: all data is dirty. All of it.” Meredith Broussard, _Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World_

- “Big Data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future.” Cathy O'Neil, _Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy_


# Course Motivation

Data are more prevalent than ever!

But does quantification equal precision? Or knowledge? Or understanding?

- Numbers without context are meaningless.
- _How_ is data collected? What is actually being _measured_?
- What might be wrong/misleading/misinterpreted?
- Theory-driven? Data-Driven?

Data-driven decisions and conclusions require multiple skills...
...and such skills are in high demand.

# What we will do...

- How to think about data. (Theory-driven vs. `data-driven)
- How to work with data in a modern, widely-used, statistical programming language.
- How to analyze?  How to present? [Reproducible!]
- Empower you to collect, and analyze new data to describe and understand the world

# What we will NOT do...

- Talk (too much) about any one topic.
- Provide a comprehensive understanding of any subject.
- Cover the latest and greatest Data Science tools and methods. 

# Some of what we will talk about:

- Predicting Elections
- Predicting College Admission Decisions (and Enrollment)
- Visualizing Pandemic Data
- Analyzing Consumer Choice

# Preliminaries

- Where to find things
- How class will work
- Expectations: attendance, assignments, guided exercises
- Communication
- Health and Safety
- Honor Code
- Technology

# Your first assignment

- Go and get R!
- Go and get Rstudio!
- Open them up!
- Take a picture!
