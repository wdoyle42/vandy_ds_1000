# Course Motivation via ``Tweets"
-  "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data." Sherlock Holmes

-  "Torture the data, and it will confess to anything." Ronald Coase, Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics 

- “Here’s an open secret of the big data world: all data is dirty. All of it.” Meredith Broussard, _Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World_

- “Big Data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future.” Cathy O'Neil, _Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy_

# Course Motivation

Data are more prevalent than ever!

But does quantification equal precision? Or knowledge? Or understanding?

- Numbers without context are meaningless.

- _How_ is data collected? What is actually being _measured_?

- What might be wrong/misleading/misinterpreted?

- Theory-driven? Data-Driven?

Data-driven decisions and conclusions require multiple skills...
...and such skills are in high demand.

# What is "Data Science"?

- No agreed upon definition.

- Set of skills: statistics, programming, communication, critical-thinking.

# Everyone is doing it?

# What we will do...

- How to think about data. (What are we doing and what can we do with data?)

- Work with data in a modern, widely-used, statistical programming language.

- How to analyze?  How to present? [Reproducible!]

- Empower you to collect, and analyze new data to describe and understand the world

# What we will NOT do...

- Talk (too much) about any one topic.

- Provide a comprehensive understanding of any subject.

- Cover the latest and greatest Data Science tools and methods (but `tidyverse`,`ggplot`,`tidymodels`)

# What does "Introduction" mean?

- This is not "Foundations"...

- Give you experience in running code (copy, paste, \& tweak)

- Not going through every function in detail...

- Or the math that justifies what we are doing and why...

- Focus on intuition and motivation.

# Some of what we will talk about:

- Predicting elections in the United States using polls

- Looking at why some movies may make more money than others

- Predicting college admission and enrollment decisions

- Identifying "clusters" of voters (unsupervised learning)

- Analyzing twitter data (sentiment analysis)

- Predicting who wrote contested documents (Textual Forensics)

# How to succeed:

Before Class

- Download the lecture notes (and data) prior to class.

- Put in a separate folder and see if you can load the data and knit the code. (Libraries?)

- Review the lecture notes to get a sense of where we are going. Figure out where you get lost in the notes.

\pause
During Class:

- During class (if not before), try to predict what each code chunk will do before you run it.  

- During class (and after), ask questions about points of confusion.  If you have a question so do others!  

\pause
After Class:

- Tweak the code to do something similar, but different.  Can you do figure out how to use the code to do something different?

- Understand that you will not "think in code" -- your goal is to give yourself tools to get the right answer.

# You Can Do This
